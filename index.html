                                    Git is a great software for a group of designers that want to create and demo a short notice website redesign prototype. The branch workflow is a huge feature that attributes to what sets Git perfect for website redesign. This feature has an isolated environment for every change to the codebase. This allows the designer to work on any bit of the code individually before adding it to the master branch so that everything added to the redesign can be perfected and won’t effect the entire coding off the website if a mistake is made. This is a lot more reliable than entering the code all at once. Git has also the ability to retrace your steps and go back to early versions of the coding, this is very helpful if you go down a long tangent of trying to fix something and you can’t get back to the version that was actually working with git you can go back to multiple different versions of the code because of how it tracks and saves snapshots of the code that you are producing. Github is also essentially as you can load your code on an open server that can allow other people to view and help you with your code. This only happens when you upload it off your closed server. The changes to your code can only be but in place when you commit your new coding to a repository allowing designers to play around with their codes with out fear of ruining everything. Git allows for a faster working style when designing a website which allows for faster prototyping with a lot of feedback that can then be worked on individually in smaller parts of the code. After looking into and reading about Git it is an essential part of coding that makes it a lot easier for first time coders such as myself.

                                    Today we went over figma which looked like an excellent tool for protoyping and wireframing websites before actually coding one. After this we played around with flex boxes and how they workend in terms of the margins paddings inside of them. I also played around with adjusting the flexboxes to fit a phone screen I found this challenging but got it in the end. file:///Users/dt/Desktop/Tutorial-5/index.html
